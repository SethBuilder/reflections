What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
the hidden git file .git starts to track commits made on the files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I think when you send something to staging area you can double check the change before commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
because I can then focus on the files I'm interested in interms of applying change and avoid 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
experimetning, working on new features. also, keeping a branch for production and other branches for development and testing things.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

by telling me the flow of commits and what would show on git log and also help me identify lost commits
