When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to work with other people also when I want to share my repo and include a link for other people to see the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might prefer to keep a clear idea of what my local repository looks like and what it does. afterthat I might check the github repo and also understand how it's different and if it includes any problems or bugs I don't want on my computer. once I decide to sync the two. that is especially truw when there're several contributers to github repo and I'm not sure what they did yet so syncing their work might mess up my local repo.
